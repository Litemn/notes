# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization
- `Cargo.toml` defines the package (Rust edition 2024) and dependencies. `Cargo.lock` is generated by Cargo; commit it when dependencies are added.
- `src/main.rs` is the current entry point. Add new modules under `src/` and expose shared logic via `mod` trees to keep `main.rs` thin.
- Place integration tests in `tests/` (create as needed). Keep large fixtures under `tests/fixtures/`.
- `target/` is build output; it should stay untracked. `notes.md` is a general scratchpad—avoid mixing it with runtime outputs.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
- `cargo build` — compile the project locally.
- `cargo run` — build and execute the binary (useful for quick manual checks).
- `cargo test` — run the full test suite (unit + integration).
- `cargo fmt` / `cargo fmt -- --check` — format code or verify formatting.
- `cargo clippy -- -D warnings` — lint with Clippy and fail on warnings; prefer running before opening a PR.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
- Follow `rustfmt` defaults; prefer small, focused modules and functions. Use 4-space indentation.
- Naming: `snake_case` for functions/variables, `PascalCase` for types/traits, `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE` for constants/static values.
- Write doc comments with `///` on public items and add brief examples where helpful.
- Avoid panics in library-like code paths; prefer `Result` returns with clear error types or messages.

## Testing Guidelines
- Add unit tests in `#[cfg(test)] mod tests` blocks within the relevant file; use integration tests in `tests/` for end-to-end behavior.
- Aim for meaningful coverage on new logic; include edge cases and error paths.
- Keep test names descriptive (`function_under_test_case_expected`) and avoid shared mutable state.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
- Commits: use present-tense, imperative subjects (e.g., `Add argument parsing`) and keep summaries under ~72 chars. Group logically related changes; avoid mixing refactors with behavior changes when possible.
- PRs: include a short description of the change, test/command output (`cargo test`, `cargo fmt -- --check`, `cargo clippy -- -D warnings`), and any relevant screenshots for user-facing behavior. Link related issues or tickets when available.
